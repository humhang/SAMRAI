/*!
 * @brief Class RefinePatchStrategy<DIM> is an abstract base class that
 * defines a Strategy pattern interface for operations that a user must 
 * supply for application-specific refining of data between levels in an
 * AMR patch hierarchy and filling of physical boundary values.   
 * A concrete subclass must define four member functions to perform 
 * the following tasks:
 *
 * - define maximum stencil width for user-defined refine operations
 * - fill physical boundary conditions
 * - preprocess the interpolation
 * - postprocess the interpolation
 *
 * Note that the preprocess member function is called before standard data refine
 * using RefineOperators and the postprocessor member function is called afterwards.
 * 
 * There are two versions of the preprocess and postprocess functions.  The
 * default abstract function only takes a single box.  The user may also
 * over-ride preprocess and postprocess functions that take a box list and
 * process an entire patch at one time.  By default, the box list version
 * loops over all of the boxes in the box list and calls the other version.
 *
 * @see xfer::RefineAlgorithm
 * @see xfer::RefineSchedule
